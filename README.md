# Koten
## Description

Koten is a Typora theme. It is now still under development.

Koten now only supports English in good condition.

The name comes from Japanese Romaji, which means "古典(こてん)". I wish this theme can gives you a feeling of writing classical literatures.

 Plans:

- [ ] Koten Light
- [ ] Koten Dark
- [ ] Koten Classical, a theme supports to write vertically

## Usage
